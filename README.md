  Users can add new tasks through a form, with input validation.

- **Delete TODO**  
  Remove tasks with a confirmation dialog before deletion.

- **Mark TODO as Done**  
  Users can mark tasks as completed with visual indicators.

- **Count TODOs**  
  Display the total number of tasks in the footer.

- **Search TODOs**  
  Implement a search bar to filter tasks based on user input.

- **Data Storage**  
  Persist TODOs using LocalStorage to maintain data across refreshes.

- **Inline Edit**  
  Allow users to edit the content of a task directly on the list.
